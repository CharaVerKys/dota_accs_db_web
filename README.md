# dota_accs_db_web
web-app for organizing accs data
---
This app was created privately, but remains unreleased due to being aborted by client.
I used express.js, vue.js (as library), scss.
As of now this app is not complete.
At least need to reorganize code, add password encryption in DB and after deploy recreate with vue.cli

This is my first full-stack(api) project and it have some architectural mistakes.

Starting can be hard because i so borred to use variable in host name now.
request install:
* postgress
* node.js
* nginx
* 
also you will need to update BD data шт сщву and other all.. as i said before this app is uncomplete and had big mistakes (not for end project but to change code and develope new things)
